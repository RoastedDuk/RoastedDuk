I'm RoastedDuck 🐤, a 22-year old software engineer duck from Indonesia 🇮🇩. Any pronouns are fine with me but I usually go with he/him.

Here's some facts about me:
- A duck 🐤
- Codes whatever that could be coded 👾. But usually doing frontend and mobile stuff 📱
- Usually speaks in JavaScript, TypeScript, Java and Kotlin 🖥
- Hates OOP 🙅‍♂️ *(but can't get away from it)*
- Loves CSS ❤️
- Usually uses Vue, React, Tailwind and React Native ⌨️
